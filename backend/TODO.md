# FastAPI Server Implementation Plan

## Overview
Convert the existing Flask server to FastAPI with modern Python features, Pydantic models, and async support while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Setup FastAPI Project Structure
- [x] Create `backend/fastapi_server.py` as the main FastAPI application
- [ ] Create `backend/models.py` for Pydantic data models
- [ ] Create `backend/auth.py` for authentication utilities
- [ ] Create `backend/database.py` for MongoDB connection
- [x] Update `backend/requirements.txt` with FastAPI dependencies

### 2. Core Dependencies and Configuration
- [x] Install FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, python-jose, passlib, python-multipart
- [x] Setup environment variables loading
- [x] Configure CORS middleware
- [x] Setup MongoDB connection with motor (async MongoDB driver)

### 3. Authentication System
- [x] Implement JWT token creation and validation
- [x] Create password hashing utilities
- [x] Setup dependency injection for user authentication
- [ ] Implement token refresh functionality

### 4. User Management
- [x] User registration endpoint
- [x] User login endpoint
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [x] User profile management
- [ ] Referral system

### 5. Payment Integration
- [ ] PesaPal payment initiation
- [ ] Payment callback handling
- [ ] IPN (Instant Payment Notification) processing
- [ ] Currency conversion utilities

### 6. Core Business Logic
- [x] Dashboard data endpoint
- [ ] Task management (create, list, claim)
- [ ] Withdrawal system
- [ ] Voucher purchase system
- [ ] Team/referral hierarchy

### 7. Admin Endpoints
- [x] Admin dashboard with statistics
- [ ] User management (list, suspend, activate)
- [ ] Withdrawal approval/rejection
- [ ] Task management for admins
- [ ] Broadcast notifications and emails

### 8. Email Integration
- [x] Email sending functionality
- [x] Welcome emails
- [ ] Password reset emails
- [ ] Notification emails

### 9. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test all endpoints
- [ ] Validate data models
- [ ] Check authentication flow
- [ ] Verify payment integration

### 10. Deployment Configuration
- [ ] Update Dockerfile for FastAPI
- [ ] Update docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Configure nginx for FastAPI
- [ ] Setup production environment

## Current Status
- [x] Plan created and approved
- [x] Core FastAPI server implementation completed
- [x] Server successfully running on port 8001
- [x] API documentation available at http://0.0.0.0:8001/docs
- [x] Basic authentication and user management working
- [x] Dashboard endpoint implemented
- [x] Admin dashboard with statistics implemented
- [x] Email integration working
- [x] MongoDB integration completed

## Notes
- Keeping MongoDB as the database
- Maintaining all existing Flask server features
- Using FastAPI's automatic API documentation
- Implementing async where beneficial
- Server is running successfully and ready for testing

## Next Steps
- Add remaining business logic endpoints (payments, tasks, withdrawals)
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Update deployment configuration for production
